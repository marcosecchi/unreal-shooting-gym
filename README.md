# Unreal Shooting Gym
This repository serves as a companion project for my article [Artificial Intelligence in Game Development: Understanding Behavior Trees](https://www.packtpub.com/en-it/learning/author-posts/artificial-intelligence-in-game-development-understanding-behavior-trees) published on Packt learning portal.

The article serves as a gentle introduction to one of the topics covered in my book _https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Unreal-Engine-development/dp/1836205856/_ available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Unreal-Engine-development/dp/1836205856/) or on the [Packt store](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/artificial-intelligence-in-unreal-engine-5-9781836205845).
